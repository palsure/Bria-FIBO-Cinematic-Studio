FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Wide establishing shot. A rain-soaked street glistens under neon signs. 
Reflections dance in puddles. The camera slowly pushes in as a mysterious 
figure emerges from the shadows.

CLOSE-UP: The figure's face. Dramatic side lighting creates deep shadows. 
Desaturated colors. The figure's eyes catch the neon light.

EXT. ROOFTOP - GOLDEN HOUR

High angle shot looking down. The city sprawls below, bathed in warm 
golden light. The camera tilts up to reveal the skyline.

MEDIUM SHOT: Two characters stand at the edge. Warm color palette. 
Soft, natural lighting. The sun sets behind them.

FADE OUT.
